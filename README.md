# Analyzed-SCARA-for-workspace-optimization
Robotics | Kinematics | Motion Planning | Workspace Optimization

The aim was to visually map out the largest and smallest circles the SCARA robot can trace within its workspace, fully utilizing its degrees of freedom without violating mechanical constraints.

This project focuses on analyzing and determining the maximum and minimum feasible circular trajectories that a SCARA can execute within its workspace, using principles of forward and inverse kinematics to evaluate the robotâ€™s joint constraints, reachability limits, and collision-free paths.

Software  :  RT Toolbox ( Mitsubishi )

Outcomes :

- Modeled the SCARA robot using RT Toolbox software.
- Demonstrated robust motion planning within real-world constraints of robotic systems.
- Implemented kinematic analysis to simulate valid trajectory paths.
- Calculated optimal circle radii based on joint limits and arm lengths.
- Visualized circular work zones and generated trajectory plots.

Applications :
- Motion planning
- Workspace analysis
- Robotic precision tasks.

This project demonstrates a practical approach to workspace optimization and path planning in industrial robotics using SCARA.
